Intro:
=====

Automate testing code on the browser by using Rack
middleware to include JS testing code files
into your rendered HTML.

This is not useful to you. Instead, use the following for testing
stuff in the browser:

  * [Bromine.js](http://cheggeng.github.io/Bromine/)
  * [Karma (aka Testacular)](http://karma-runner.github.io/)
  * [Casper.js](http://casperjs.org/)
  * [Buster.js](http://busterjs.org/)
  * [Watir](http://watir.com)  <--- my favorite
  * ... and a million other alternatives.

Dependencies
============

  * jQuery >= 1.9.1+
  * Underscore >= 1.4.3
  * [Fermata](https://github.com/natevw/fermata) > 0.0.0

Install:
========

```ruby
  gem install akui
```

NOTE:
=====

This was originally a npm module.
That code is still available in the
[nodejs branch](https://github.com/da99/akui/tree/nodejs).
