Intro:
=====

A Ruby gem that helps me automate testing JS code on the browser.
It uses a Rack middleware to include JS testing code files
into the rendered HTML.

This is not useful to you. Instead, use the following for testing
stuff in the browser:

  * [Bromine.js](http://cheggeng.github.io/Bromine/)
  * [Karma (aka Testacular)](http://karma-runner.github.io/)
  * [Casper.js](http://casperjs.org/)
  * [Buster.js](http://busterjs.org/)
  * [Watir](http://watir.com)  <--- my favorite
  * ... and a million other alternatives.

Dependencies
============

  * jQuery >= 1.9.1+
  * Underscore >= 1.4.3
  * [Fermata](https://github.com/natevw/fermata) > 0.0.0

Install:
========

```ruby
  gem install akui
```

NOTE:
=====

This was originally a npm module.
That code is still available in the
[nodejs branch](https://github.com/da99/akui/tree/nodejs).
